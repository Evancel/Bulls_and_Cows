# Description

1. Choose a level of the game (From 1 to 36).
2. Choose how many characters: digits and lowercase letters can be in the Secret Code.
   The number of characters can be equal to or greater than the level.
   Watch out! Each character can appear in the Secret Code only once.
3. The Secret Code is generated. Try to guess it.
4. Type any character sequence,  its length should be equal to the level of your Game.
   If a character in your answer matches a character and its position in the code, it's called a "bull".
   If a given character appears in the code but its position doesn't match, then it's called a "cow."
5. You are unlimited with attempts, but let's make it funnier, try to guess from 4 or 5 attempts.
   
   **Good luck!**
